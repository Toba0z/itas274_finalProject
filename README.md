Final Project for android 

LocationBased APP for Atendance 
============================================================================

I was able to get this working using Geofrence, The purpose of this app is to be 	able to detect when a user in a particular lation E.g ITAS building and then send out a notification to the admin. 

This app is not meant to be used on a production environment but i choose to work on it for the sake of this project. 

What is working?
----------------

I was able to get set a particular location and when the user enters that particular location, notification will be sent. When a user is Dwell in the location, Notification will be sent and when a user leave the location, notification will be sent as well.

I have included a Demo video, to show what i have working.
